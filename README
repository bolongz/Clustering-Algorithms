#The program has been complied and run on the machine Linprog. 

Type "make" to compile the program.

After you type "make" you will get three executable programs: 

1. complete_linkage, which is the complete linkage method.
	
	Run method: ./complete_linkage data.txt

2. llord_clustering, which is the llord method.
	
	Run method: ./llord_clustering data.txt

3. hamming_distance, which is the the program to calculate hammming distance.
	
	Run method: ./hamming_distance


NOTE for calculating the hamming distance:
Before excuting the hamming distance program. You should run the 
complete linkage method and llord's method firstly, which will have both standard output and two output files named "out_complete.txt" and "out_llord.txt". 
The hamming distance  program will read these two files and calculate the hamming distance.

The 'bonus.m' is the matlab source file for bonus. The program should be excuted in matlab.
